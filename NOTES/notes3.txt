HTTP - higher level protocol
     - port 80 (default)
     - internal communication
     - digital certificates used in encrypting informations

"encrypts" - algorithm; transform a data to another data with the same content.

Socket - IP address and port number
Port numbers are from 0-64K

Origin server - physical web servers with different resources
	      - machine with an application running

Proxy server - intermediate machine; for authentication

Gateway - ISP (Internet service provider)

Request response chain -  no direct communication
Encryption tunnel - allows HTTP traffic to pass through.

"pull" - client -> http request message -> server -> http response message -> client
	    

"push" - allows a web server to send resources to a web browser before the browser gets to request them.

"polling" - is the continuous checking of other programs or devices by one progam or device to see what state they are in, usually to see whether they are still connected or want to communicate.

Stateless - servers do not keep information about clients in-between requests.

Cache control - restores certain things on the storage location

Content media type (MIME) specification
MIME - Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (e.g. text/html, img/png)
