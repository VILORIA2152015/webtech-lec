===Javascript===
	Client side scripting- which is to be associated with web
pages. The execution environment is the browser environment, it is by 
by far the most used client side scripting

Standard for JAVASCRIPT is ECMA=262

Link it to HTML in 3 ways
1. Link to an external file
2.Embed the script within the HTML
3.Inline script 

*It is preferred to use Link method to save space on the HTML 

===HOW IT WORKS/ HOW IT GETS EXECUTED===
	The broser parse from the top, when it encounters a link(script)
it loads and executes the script.

===ATTRIBUTES===
	deffer - attribute makes it possible for the script to load
while the HTML is loading. script is to be executed only after the document
is loaded.
	async - attribute makes it possible for the script to load while
the html is loading. script is loaded and executed even if the document is not
yet loaded

*NOTE: positioning is important without the attributes defer and async*

====EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT===
 Window object is the global object
 window.navigator - is the browser itself
 window.scree - gets information about the screen
 window.document is the HTML document

"window" is not required since it is the global object"
	Example: "window.document.write" maybe written as
		 "document.write"

===innerText vs innerHTML===
Innertext ignores markup and treats it as literal values
InnerHTML will interpret any markup
text content interprets it as a literal value

--OuterHTML includes the markup while innerHTML is just the content--
OuterHTML = <p>hello<p>
InnerHTML = hello

===Attributes can also be set in javascript===
h.title = "hello"
h.setAttribute('data-extra' 'value')
		where 'data-extra' = name of attribute and 'value' is the value

===Styles can also be set===
h.style.color = ="red"
h.style.fontSize = '2cm'

*NOTE that the values should be string*
*NOTE (-) dash is an invalid  key character in javascript
	and h.style.font-size will be invalid

More powerful css selector
"document.querySelector('p')"
"document.querySelectorAll('p:first-child')

<noscript>lorem</noscript>
	The browser may not be able to support scripts
	The text on the no script tag will pop if the browser does not support 
for script( javascript)
	
	Scripts may contain harmful or malicious contents that is why
the browser is a way to transfer malicious files. when executing in a browser
it executes in a SANDBOX

*NOTE THAT ALL WHITE SPACE ARE SIGNIFICANT*

DOM (Document Object Model)
Defines the structure of markup

Node interface - is the primary datatype for the entire DOM

Node.name ="#this contains text"
NodeType = returns if what type of node 
NodeValue = is always "null"

*NOTE in javascript quoting ' with " is valid

createElement('h1')
